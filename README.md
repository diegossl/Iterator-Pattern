# Iterator pattern

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

## Setup

```

To execute the project it is necessary to transpile the Typescript code to JavaScript. To do this, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn tsc
```

### Use

To execute the project already transpiled into JavaScript, type the following command in the terminal:
